Coding style
=============

The general coding style is derived from Java coding and naming convention with some minor C++ specific practical changes.

In particular every include file must start with '#pragma once' after copyright header.
- Rational: all target compilers support this pragma so no need to rely on define guards

Include guards, when user, must follow the pattern: {PROJECT_NAME}_{NAMESPACE}_{FILE_BASENAME -without suffix}_{FILE_SUFFIX}
Each #endif must be followed by a comment which 'condition' it closures

 * Type names are nouns and start with a Capital letter
 * Names are cameCase
 * Method names are generally verbs like a.doSomethig()
 ** One notable exception is methods that return boolean and take no arguments.
    bool isEmpty() const;

Return statement is always to be separated by an empty line from the code above it.
Only exception is when return is the only statement in a method.
- Rational: clear visual high light of a function return points.
 * Example:
 ```
    // Example of a return being the only statement:
    int getNumber() {
        return 42;
    }

    // Multiline method:
    int doCalculations() {
        int result = 0;
        ....
        result += compyteAstroResult();

        return result;
    }
```
