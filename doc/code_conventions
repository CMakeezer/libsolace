Every include file must start with '#pragma once'
- Rational: all taget compilers support this pragma so no need to rely on define guards

Include gruards, when user, must follow the pattern: {PROJECT_NAME}_{NAMESPACE}_{FILE_BASENAME -without suffix}_{FILE_SUFFIX}
Each #endif must be followed by a comment which 'condition' it closures
